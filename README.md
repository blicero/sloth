A unified CLI frontend to various Linux/Un*x package managers

I own a variety of (rather dated) computers, and I like them to run a
variety of operating systems (different GNU/Linux distros and BSD
flavors).
What I do *not* like is having to remember the different CLI
interfaces of the systems' respective package managers.
So this is my attempt to create a tool that provides a unified
interface to the user/admin and deals with the system and its package
manager behind the scenes.
